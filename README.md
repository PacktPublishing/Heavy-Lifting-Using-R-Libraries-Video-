# Heavy-Lifting Using R Libraries [Video]
This is the code repository for [Heavy-Lifting Using R Libraries [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/heavy-lifting-using-r-libraries-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788395816), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
In this video course, you will learn to tap some of the powerful abilities of R. R is one of the leading packages in the world with a vast number of active users and, as a result, has a massive number of state-of-the-art libraries. You will master the basics and get comfortable with R, so you can then use its libraries to do the heavy-lifting. You'll begin by looking at high-performance computing in the classic, computationally intensive scenario: finding prime numbers.Then you'll learn how to use R, before moving on to using C++, which is far faster. Next you will use the power of parallel, though that varies from problem to problem since some are more suitable for parallelization. Then you will look at some powerful options available on R where you don't just produce a static result but instead respond to user selections. This will be a small sample of the countless alternatives out there. Having learnt that there are exciting things going on in data science, you can now begin your journey in whatever specialized niche you wish. Don't stop here, this is just the start. There are active R communities on the internet and many Packt books and courses to take you to where you want to go!
