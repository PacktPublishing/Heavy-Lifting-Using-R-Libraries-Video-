## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(forecast)
library(Quandl)

# NOTE:
# 1.This is not a static picture.This loads in the data and creates the plot.
# 2.The code that generates the plot is included and so can be checked/tested to confirm what it is doing?
# 3.We also have the data that was used so nothing is hidden, everything is shared/trasparent!

temperatures=Quandl("EPI/74")#average global temp data
temp=temperatures[,2] #picks out the temp data field
shares=rev(temp) #want to reverse to get increasing
arima=auto.arima(shares) #auto.arima fits the best ARIMA model
plot(forecast(arima,h=50))
#plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
